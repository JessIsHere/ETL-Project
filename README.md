Data Sources
1. Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative: https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/download-global-dataset
   
   This dataset is the backbone of the project. Human Trafficking has always existed. However, in the US, it has 
   only been a crime since 2000. This means that the exploitation of people was not tracked or measured with the 
   exception of the last 20 years. The lack of accurate, consistent data keeps us from identifying people who are suffering.
   The Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative is seeking to provide a solution by aggregating data 
   from five global agencies. This project was the perfect opportunity to attempt a database design for this challenging
   dataset.
   
2. World Bank API - Wealth of Countries: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation
  Our main dataset focused on exploitation of people for labor. We decided to access the World Bank API to pull financial
  data on each country. The World Bank data provides the opportunity to explore instances of trafficking in relation to the     countries financial status. 

3. World Bank CSV - Labour Force By Year: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN 
  Similarly with the fiancial data for each country, we wanted to pull in data related to the yearly labor force 
  from 2012 - 2017.
